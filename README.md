## Share My Help

This project connects people willing to help others with those that need this help.
The application works by rewarding helpers with points that they can use to 
get help or simply sell those points to other users for money.

After registering for the application, the user is given enough points for a 
small favor. In order to obtain more help, one needs to first help someone else.

The reasoning behind, is to motivate others to help by creating and environment
where helping others is rewarded.

and versions in different environments, we can build more reliable
software.
